## Int8Array

The Int8Array typed array represents an array of twos-complement 8-bit signed integers. The contents are initialized to 0. Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation).

Int8Array is a subclass of the hidden TypedArray class.
